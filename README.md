# SDF-Test
An experiment in Signed Distance Field (SDF) raytracing and raymarching

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zesterer/sdf-test/master/misc/screen.png "The current progress of the SDF raytracer")

This is my attempt at making a high-quality semi-photorealistic raytracer in C++. I use GLM as a maths library, and SDL as a windowing library.

It was hacked together in about 24 hours, so don't expect pretty code. But what it renders is quite pretty in my humble opinion.

It's not quick, it's not optimised. It usually takes about 30 seconds to render an image. Sorry about that.
